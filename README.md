# TI-84-Python
## Description
This is a collection of TI-84 programs written in python. I'm only testing these to work on TI-84s, but most if not all programs should work on anything that runs python.

## Install
Get TI Connect on a computer and connect your calculator to the computer.

Drag the .py file onto the file system of the calculator and select where you want to store it.

The file should automatically be converted into a version that the calculator can run.

## Contributing
This is not a real project but rather a code dump for all the things on my calculator. If there are any efficiency or accuracy issues, feel free to fork, make a pull request, and/or submit an issue. All contributions are welcome.

## License
This has no license. You can do anything you want with this code.
